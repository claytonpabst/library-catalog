# Library Catalog Manager

This is a full stack React app with a functioning database. It has two sides, the user side and the admin side. Check out what each side can do:

### User Functionality
- see all books, and filter them alphabetically or by year
- search for a book by title
- search for a book series
- search for an author
- When they select a book, they can see how many copies the library has, how many copies are available, and the waitlist length (if applicable)

### Admin Functionality
- Everything a normal user can do, plus the following
- login to gain access to additional functionality
- create a new membership account
- edit or delete existing membership accounts
- add a new book to the system
- edit or delete an existing book from the system
- check a book out to a member/patron
- check a book back in to the library and have it be available again
- view a member's account & see what books they have checked out, their due dates, and any fees they might have from overdue books
- waive fees on a member's account

## Purpose

This app showcases my ability to create functional, full stack apps with a real world application using the React framework. 

## Tech

- React with Redux on the front end.
- Node, Express, Massive, and SQL for the back end.
